# Virtual Network resource creation example

Configuration in this directory creates a set of Azure network resources. Few of these resources added/excluded as per your requirement.

## Module Usage

Following example to create a simple virtual network with subnets and network watcher resources. Please see the complete example to add rest of the features in this module.

```hcl
# Azurerm provider configuration
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

module "vnet" {
  source  = "kumarvna/vnet/azurerm"
  version = "2.2.0"

  # By default, this module will not create a resource group, proivde the name here
  # to use an existing resource group, specify the existing resource group name,
  # and set the argument to `create_resource_group = true`. Location will be same as existing RG.
  create_resource_group         = true
  resource_group_name           = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  vnetwork_name                 = "vnet-demo-westeurope-001"
  location                      = "westeurope"
  vnet_address_space            = ["10.1.0.0/16"]
  gateway_subnet_address_prefix = ["10.1.1.0/27"]

  # Adding Standard DDoS Plan, and custom DNS servers (Optional)
  create_ddos_plan = true

  # Multiple Subnets, Service delegation, Service Endpoints, Network security groups
  # These are default subnets with required configuration, check README.md for more details
  # NSG association to be added automatically for all subnets listed here.
  # First two address ranges from VNet Address space reserved for Gateway And Firewall Subnets.
  # ex.: For 10.1.0.0/16 address space, usable address range start from 10.1.2.0/24 for all subnets.
  # subnet name will be set as per Azure naming convention by defaut. expected value here is: <App or project name>
  subnets = {
    mgnt_subnet = {
      subnet_name           = "management"
      subnet_address_prefix = ["10.1.2.0/24"]
      service_endpoints     = ["Microsoft.Storage"]
    }

    dmz_subnet = {
      subnet_name           = "appgateway"
      subnet_address_prefix = ["10.1.3.0/24"]
      service_endpoints     = ["Microsoft.Storage"]
    }
  }

  # Adding TAG's to your Azure resources (Required)
  tags = {
    ProjectName  = "demo-internal"
    Env          = "dev"
    Owner        = "user@example.com"
    BusinessUnit = "CORP"
    ServiceClass = "Gold"
  }
}
```

## Terraform Usage

To run this example you need to execute following Terraform commands

```hcl
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
